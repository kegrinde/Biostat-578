**This is your first homework due Tuesday Jan 22.**

1. Create a repository on GitHub called "HW1_first_lastname" where `first` and `lastname` are your first and last names. This will avoid confusion when forking your partner's repo.

2. Initialize your repo with a README file to explain its content. You may wish to chose a license.

3. Use the ggplot2 package to plot the Iris data showing length vs width facetting petal/sepal vs flower type, basically reproducing slide 27 of the lecture notes. Feel free to customize the styling as you see fit (color, font size, etc).

Please submit your code as an Rmd file that can be used to check your queries and show the results. 

Remember to comment your code as much as possible and use good coding standards. 

Your partner will work with you to check that he/she can reproduce the submitted html file, and will perform a pull request to fix any issues or improve the code.
