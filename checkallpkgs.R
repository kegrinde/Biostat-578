# checkallpkgs.R
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This script attempts to find all of the R packages used in all
# of the R presentation files in the current working folder and then 
# attempts to install them with "biocLite" then tries to load them 
# into memory with "require". The intent is to ensure that any packages 
# required for the scripts to run have been installed previously. 
#
# Only those packages which are not already installed will be installed. 
# The "require" function is used to check those packages after 
# they are installed to make sure they can load into memory. Therefore, 
# even if packages have already been loaded with "library", this script 
# should run very quickly once the packages have been initially installed.
#
# This script was initially developed for use with course materials of
# "BIOSTAT 578A: Bioinformatics for Big Omics Data", specifically the  
# files (*.Rpres, *.Rmd) found at https://github.com/raphg/Biostat-578/
#
# The idea is to download the course materials with "git clone", then
# run this script to install all of the packages used in presentation files
# so that the slides will display properly when run using, e.g., RStudio.
# Since many of the presentaions do not include installation commands 
# for all of the required packages, the slides may not display properly
# without installing packages beforehand.
#
# Usage: 
#
#   1. Use setwd() to set the working directory to the folder containing
#      the R script and R presentation files.
#
#   2. Run this command: source("checkallpkgs.R")
#      ... where you should use the actual file path to this script.
